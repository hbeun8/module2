## Developer: Varun Gupta

Purpose of the website: This project builds on the work performed in Module 1 - Eclectic Cycles. For this project we have added Journey Planner and Comparer to the website so that users can plan their journey using rented electric cycles. Furthermore, it also allows the user make comparisions with other modes of transportation such as Walking, Buses, Tube and Car. 

Over the shorter distance, shared E-Cycles has demonstrated itself to be more virtuous than mass public demonstration, by being quicker, more affordable, more flexible and with zero emissions it is also kinder to mother nature. It is the aim of the project to evidence this with live data using the Transport for London Api live data.

In order to avoid duplication, we have referred to Module 1 Readme.md so that user has a source for all vital information.

# 5. Features {#5-features}

1.  ## Landing Page

    This shows the features of the Landing Page, which includes responsive design of navigation bar and buttons. The website is mobile friendly too.

2.  ## Dynamic Coverage and Cost Details for Each Provider

    Details of coverage area and prices for each provider

    Also, this provides users with information on what types of electric vehicles are on offer from our participants.

3. ## Dynamic Bookings/ Plan your Journey Page.

    This is a demo/static page. The idea of this page is that users will be able to plan their journey/ get information on the cost and time it takes to travel through diverse mix of mass public transportation.<br>

    Furthermore, through an embeded google maps link, user can see what bikes are available in the area giving great choice.<br>

4. ## Dynamic Clock

    This is a clock that shows local time and is updated everysecond. The time starts automatically using window.onload method.

Colors and fonts chosen are easy to read and accessible by running it through lighthouse in dev-tools.

## Performance

No issues observed while loading page

## Device Testing

The webpage was designed to operate on different screen-sizes. The coding was defined using mobile first principles.

## Browser compatibility

Compatible with all browsers based on MDN.org Also, accessibility checked using Lighthouse built in the Chrome Dev Tool.

## Testing user stories

We took feedback from two group: <br>
1. General user on the UX design and stories.<br> 
2. Student Coders in classroom on the design principles and other technical aspects. Based on the feedback provided, the website was enhanced to incorporate the suggestion.
